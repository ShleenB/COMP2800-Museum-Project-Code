COMP2800-Museum-Project-Code

The zip file in this repository contains all of the code and assets used to create our museum simulator for our COMP-2800.
Within the zip file is a 'ReadMe' text file containing all of the instructions to run the code, which requires an IDE to run (preferably Eclipse or Visual Studio Code).

The project included usage of the Scrum/Agile Framework to schedule and document all contributions to project code, assets, etc.
